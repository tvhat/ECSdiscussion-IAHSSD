# ECSdiscussion-IAHSSD
Blueprint for ECS discussion sessions on the theme of the next IAHS Scientific Decade

We shared an Early-Career Scientist (ECS) perspective on potential themes for the upcoming International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) scientific decade (SD) here: https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/3353/. Six discussion sessions were organised in four countries in western Europe in spring 2022. Early-career hydrologists were invited to join the sessions to formulate potential SD themes, to provide feedback on themes proposed in earlier sessions, and to further develop the proposed themes. 
We invite other ECS to continue the discussion on the IAHS SD. This github page provides a guideline based on the discussion sessions for this initiative. The schedule describes an one-hour session with 20-40 people, which can be extended to accommodate for more interaction. Depending on the session, we deviated slightly from the schedule responding to the course of the discussion. The questions that served as input for the discussion are provided in the questions document. The questions evolved over the course of the six discussion sessions. To provide insight in this evolution, the questions are presented per session.
